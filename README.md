# git-prompt

This is my prompt, which provides all sorts of useful information about the current status of Git repositories. It is written in pure Bash.

## Dependencies

* Bash 4.x is highly recommended. (OS X Mavericks only comes with Bash 3.x.)
* GNU sed (aka `gsed`, as opposed to the other `sed`) is highly recommended.

If you are running a modern version of OS X, you can install these via Homebrew or MacPorts.

## Other stuff

If you're running OS X, check out my [Type-R Terminal style](https://github.com/skyzyx/terminal-style).

Also, I'm a big fan of using [Meslo LG S](https://github.com/andreberg/Meslo-Font) 14pt for my Terminal. Give it a whirl!

You can set them in the Terminal.app `Preferences pane â†’ Startup`.
